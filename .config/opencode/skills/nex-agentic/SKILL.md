# Nex Agentic Development Skill

Orchestrate multi-agent development workflows using the Nex terminal
multiplexer. Spawn named child panes, start Claude agents in them, distribute
work, and collect results.

## Prerequisites

You must be running inside a Nex pane (the `NEX_PANE_ID` environment variable
is set). Verify with:

```bash
echo $NEX_PANE_ID
```

If this is empty, you are not inside Nex and these commands will silently no-op.

## Nex CLI Reference

The `nex` CLI communicates with the Nex app over a Unix socket at `/tmp/nex.sock`.

### Pane Commands

```bash
# Split a pane (creates a new pane alongside)
nex pane split [--direction horizontal|vertical] [--path /dir] [--name <label>] [--target <name-or-uuid>]

# Create a new pane (alias for horizontal split)
nex pane create [--path /dir] [--name <label>] [--target <name-or-uuid>]

# Close current pane
nex pane close

# Set a label on current pane (visible as pill badge in title bar)
nex pane name <label>

# Send text to another pane (typed into its PTY + Enter)
nex pane send --to <label-or-uuid> <command...>
```

### Event Commands (Agent Lifecycle)

```bash
nex event start                    # Signal agent started
nex event stop                     # Signal agent stopped
nex event error --message "..."    # Signal error
nex event notification --title "..." --body "..."  # Desktop notification
```

### Workspace Commands

```bash
nex workspace create [--name "..."] [--path /dir] [--color blue|green|red|yellow|purple|orange|pink|gray]
```

### Key Behaviors

- **Target resolution** for `pane send`: tries UUID first, then label in same
  workspace, then label across all workspaces.
- **`--name` flag**: names the new pane at creation time so it can be
  immediately targeted by `pane send`.
- **`--target` flag**: on `split`/`create`, specifies which existing pane to
  split by name or UUID (defaults to the current pane via `NEX_PANE_ID`). This
  lets a coordinator split any named pane, not just itself.
- **Silent fallback**: if `NEX_PANE_ID` is unset or the socket is unavailable,
  all commands exit silently with code 0.
- **`pane send` mechanics**: text is sent directly to the target pane's PTY
  followed by an Enter keypress. If a shell is running, the text executes as a
  shell command. If Claude is running in interactive mode, the text becomes a
  prompt.

## Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fan-Out with Markdown Communication (Recommended)

The coordinator creates named child panes, assigns tasks via markdown files,
and collects results from markdown output files.

#### Step 1: Set up the workspace

```bash
# Name the coordinator pane
nex pane name coordinator

# Create a shared communication directory
mkdir -p .nex-tasks .nex-results
```

#### Step 2: Write task files

Write a markdown file for each worker describing its task:

```bash
# Write task files (use the Write tool, not echo)
# .nex-tasks/worker-1.md
# .nex-tasks/worker-2.md
# etc.
```

Each task file should include:
- Clear description of the work to do
- Input files/context needed
- Expected output format
- Where to write results (e.g., `.nex-results/worker-1.md`)

#### Step 3: Spawn named worker panes

```bash
# Create named worker panes
nex pane split --name worker-1 --direction vertical
nex pane split --name worker-2 --direction horizontal
nex pane split --name worker-3 --direction horizontal
```

**Timing**: add a short delay (1-2 seconds) between spawning panes to allow
each surface to initialize before sending commands.

#### Step 4: Start Claude agents in worker panes

```bash
# Send Claude commands to each worker
sleep 2
nex pane send --to worker-1 claude -p "Read .nex-tasks/worker-1.md and complete the task described. Write your results to .nex-results/worker-1.md"
sleep 1
nex pane send --to worker-2 claude -p "Read .nex-tasks/worker-2.md and complete the task described. Write your results to .nex-results/worker-2.md"
sleep 1
nex pane send --to worker-3 claude -p "Read .nex-tasks/worker-3.md and complete the task described. Write your results to .nex-results/worker-3.md"
```

#### Step 5: Poll for results

```bash
# Wait for result files to appear
while [ ! -f .nex-results/worker-1.md ] || [ ! -f .nex-results/worker-2.md ] || [ ! -f .nex-results/worker-3.md ]; do
  sleep 5
done
```

Then read each result file and synthesize.

#### Step 6: Clean up

```bash
# Close worker panes when done
nex pane send --to worker-1 exit
nex pane send --to worker-2 exit
nex pane send --to worker-3 exit
```

### Pattern 2: Direct Messaging Between Panes

For simpler coordination, send commands directly between panes without markdown
files. Best for short, one-off commands.

```bash
# From coordinator, run a build in a named pane
nex pane split --name build
sleep 2
nex pane send --to build make build

# Run tests in another pane
nex pane split --name test
sleep 2
nex pane send --to test make test
```

### Pattern 3: Interactive Agent Swarm

Start multiple Claude agents in interactive mode that can message each other.

```bash
# Coordinator creates workers
nex pane split --name reviewer --direction vertical
nex pane split --name coder --direction horizontal

sleep 2

# Start Claude in each with role context
nex pane send --to reviewer claude
sleep 2
nex pane send --to reviewer "You are a code reviewer. Review any code written to .nex-results/code.md and write your review to .nex-results/review.md"

nex pane send --to coder claude
sleep 2
nex pane send --to coder "You are a coder. Write code for the task in .nex-tasks/feature.md and save it to .nex-results/code.md"
```

## Task File Format

When creating task files for workers, use this structure:

```markdown
# Task: <short description>

## Context
<background information, relevant files, architecture notes>

## Objective
<clear, specific description of what to accomplish>

## Inputs
- <file paths, data sources, or references the worker needs>

## Expected Output
- Write results to: `.nex-results/<worker-name>.md`
- Create/modify source files as described below

## Constraints
- <any boundaries, e.g., "do not modify files outside src/components/">
- <time/scope limits>
```

## Result File Format

Workers should write results in this format:

```markdown
# Result: <task description>

## Status
<completed | partial | failed>

## Summary
<1-3 sentence overview of what was done>

## Changes Made
- <list of files created/modified with brief descriptions>

## Notes
- <any issues encountered, decisions made, or follow-up needed>
```

## Practical Tips

1. **Always name your coordinator pane first** (`nex pane name coordinator`)
   so workers can message back if needed.

2. **Use `claude -p` for workers** (print mode). It runs non-interactively
   with full tool access and exits when done. This is better than interactive
   mode for autonomous workers.

3. **Add delays between pane operations**. The terminal surfaces need time to
   initialize. A 1-2 second sleep between `pane split` and `pane send` prevents
   race conditions.

4. **Use the `.nex-tasks/` and `.nex-results/` convention** for the shared
   communication directory. This keeps agent artifacts organized and
   `.gitignore`-able.

5. **Poll with `sleep` loops for results**, not busy-waits. Check every 5-10
   seconds for result files.

6. **Keep task descriptions self-contained**. Workers run in fresh Claude
   sessions with no shared context. Include all necessary information in the
   task file.

7. **Workers should use absolute paths** or paths relative to the project root
   to avoid working directory confusion.

8. **For large fan-outs (>4 workers)**, create panes in batches to avoid
   overwhelming the terminal. Spawn 3-4, wait for them to complete, then spawn
   the next batch.

## Coordinator Script Template

Here is a complete coordinator script you can adapt:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Nex multi-agent coordinator
set -e

PROJECT_DIR="$(pwd)"
TASK_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/.nex-tasks"
RESULT_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/.nex-results"
WORKERS=("worker-1" "worker-2" "worker-3")

# Setup
nex pane name coordinator
mkdir -p "$TASK_DIR" "$RESULT_DIR"
rm -f "$RESULT_DIR"/*.md  # Clean previous results

# Task files should already exist in $TASK_DIR/<worker-name>.md

# Spawn workers
for worker in "${WORKERS[@]}"; do
  nex pane split --name "$worker" --direction horizontal
  sleep 2
done

# Start agents
for worker in "${WORKERS[@]}"; do
  nex pane send --to "$worker" "cd $PROJECT_DIR && claude -p 'Read $TASK_DIR/$worker.md and complete the task. Write results to $RESULT_DIR/$worker.md'"
  sleep 1
done

# Wait for all results
echo "Waiting for workers to complete..."
all_done=false
while [ "$all_done" = false ]; do
  all_done=true
  for worker in "${WORKERS[@]}"; do
    if [ ! -f "$RESULT_DIR/$worker.md" ]; then
      all_done=false
      break
    fi
  done
  sleep 5
done

echo "All workers complete. Results in $RESULT_DIR/"
```

## Error Handling

- If a worker fails, its result file won't appear. The coordinator should
  implement a timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) and report which workers didn't
  complete.
- Workers can signal errors via `nex event error --message "description"`.
- Workers can send desktop notifications via
  `nex event notification --title "Done" --body "Task complete"`.
